# TortoiseBot Mini

## 1. Installation

### 1.1 Download Arduino IDE

Download the latest version Arduino IDE from <https://www.arduino.cc/en/software>

### 1.2 Setup ESP board in Arduino IDE

Follow the following tutorial to add ESP board in your Arduino IDE - <https://randomnerdtutorials.com/how-to-install-esp8266-board-arduino-ide/>

Simply go to Files > Preferences and add the following line in the Additional Board Managers URLs:

><https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json>, <http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json>

After that go into Tools > Board > Boards Manager and search for "esp8266" and install the ESP8266 board by ESP8266 Community. That's it!

### 1.3 Install ROS Serial Library for Arduino on Ubuntu

```shell
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rosserial-arduino
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rosserial
```

### 1.4 Clone the TortoiseBot Mini Repo

Clone the TortoiseBot Mini repo into your src folder of your catkin workspace

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rigbetellabs/tortoisebot_mini
```

## 2. Setup

### 2.1 Change Wi-Fi's SSID and Password

Open the [espros_cmd_vel](https://github.com/rigbetellabs/tortoisebot_mini/blob/506f832b9e0385ce1e38ce5b1219167dbe5a9f84/esp/espros_cmd_vel/espros_cmd_vel.ino) code in Arduino IDE and change the SSID and Password on line number 10 & 11 to that of your Wi-Fi Connection.

### 2.2 Change the ROS Master IP Address

Check the IP Address of your ROS Master PC using ifconfig command and put that in line number 14 of [espros_cmd_vel](https://github.com/rigbetellabs/tortoisebot_mini/blob/506f832b9e0385ce1e38ce5b1219167dbe5a9f84/esp/espros_cmd_vel/espros_cmd_vel.ino) code with commas(,) instead of dot(.)

### 2.3 Check Board and Port

Make sure the switch on motor driver board is turned off and battery is not connected and then connect your ESP8266 board to your computer using USB type B cable. Make sure the board is selected to "NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)" in Arduino IDE and select the appropriate Port as well.

### 2.4 Upload the Code

Upload the [espros_cmd_vel](https://github.com/rigbetellabs/tortoisebot_mini/blob/506f832b9e0385ce1e38ce5b1219167dbe5a9f84/esp/espros_cmd_vel/espros_cmd_vel.ino) code on your ESP8266 Node MCU board.

### 2.5 Connection

Once code is Successfully uploaded, disconnect the USB Cable and connect the DC Jack of Battery to Motor Driver Board.

DO NOT TURN ON THE ROBOT YET!

## 3. Demo

### 3.1 Running ROS Master

Launch the [tortoisebot_mini.launch](https://github.com/rigbetellabs/tortoisebot_mini/blob/506f832b9e0385ce1e38ce5b1219167dbe5a9f84/launch/tortoisebot_mini.launch) file on your Master PC to start ROS Master along with ROS Serial Node.

```shell
roslaunch tortoisebot_mini tortoisebot_mini.launch
```

It will prompt a INFO message saying "Waiting for socket connections on port 11411 waiting for socket connection".

### 3.2 Turning on Robot

Once the above INFO message is popped up, then you can turn on your Robot upon which you will see that different ROS topics start automatically.

### 3.3 Testing out Teleop

Keep the previous terminal running ad on a new terminal type the following command to start the teleoperation node.

```shell
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
```

Now you can control the robot using teleoperation commands.
